##### Abstract

This working paper investigates how historical institutions shape the quality of politicians and the allocation of state capacity in India. We build on variation in colonial land and governance arrangements to study how different institutional legacies map into today’s political selection, focusing on the types of candidates who win elections and the public services they prioritize.

We combine historical administrative data with modern election results and measures of public goods provision to document how institutional history predicts both who runs for office and how responsive they are to constituent needs. The goal is to understand whether some institutional environments systematically encourage rent-seeking or clientelist politicians, while others foster higher-quality representation and more effective last-mile delivery of public services.
