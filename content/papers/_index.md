## Working papers 

- [**Adapting for scale: Experimental evidence on computer-aided instruction in India**](paper1/)

## Works in progress

- [**Coordination frictions and last-mile delivery of public services**](paper2/)  
  Concept note and pilot design (with Narendar Singh Bhandari). We reorganize existing frontline health and nutrition workers across departments to improve immunization, antenatal care, and related outcomes at scale in India.
