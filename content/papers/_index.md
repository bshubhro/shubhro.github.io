## Working papers

- **Adapting for scale: Experimental evidence on computer-aided instruction in India**  
  Experimental evidence on how computer-aided instruction performs when moved from tightly controlled pilots to larger-scale implementation, and what this implies for education policy and program design.

## Works in progress

- **Coordination frictions and last-mile delivery of public services**  
  Concept note and pilot design (with Narendar Singh Bhandari). We reorganize existing frontline health and nutrition workers across departments to improve immunization, antenatal care, and related outcomes at scale in India.

- **Historical institutions and political selection**  
  Early-stage work linking colonial land tenure systems to modern political competition and the allocation of state capacity in India.

- **Local governance, bank branches, and financial inclusion**  
  Data work on how gram panchayat boundaries and economies of scale shape access to formal financial services in rural India.
