##### Abstract

This working paper studies whether “sustainability starts at home”: can children be effective agents of change for household environmental practices? We evaluate a school-based intervention implemented with roughly 3,000 students in Bihar, India, which combines environmental education, experiential activities, and simple take-home tasks that encourage conversations between children and caregivers. We measure impacts on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to waste management, water use, and sanitation, both for children and for their households. The project leverages randomized variation in exposure at the school or class level and combines survey data with simple behavioral measures. The goal is to understand whether child-focused programs can induce persistent changes in household environmental practices in low-income urban and peri-urban settings.
