##### Abstract

This study evaluates how environmental education shapes household behavior through the
intergenerational transmission of knowledge, beliefs and attitudes. We implement a novel
activity-based environmental education program tailored to the local context in Patna, India, and
designed to engage both children and adults. We test the direct effects of the intervention on
participants and spillovers to non-participating family members in a randomized field experiment
with 1,545 child–parent pairs. Households were assigned to one of three treatment
arms—child-only, parent-only, or joint child–parent participation—or to a control group. We find
that direct participation increases pro-environmental behaviors. Spillover effects are present but
asymmetric. While both children and parents influence one another, only children shift their
parents’ beliefs and attitudes toward climate change. After accounting for spillovers, joint
participation does not produce stronger outcomes than participation by either group individually,
suggesting that targeting children may be a more scalable and cost-effective approach to
promoting sustainable household behavior.
