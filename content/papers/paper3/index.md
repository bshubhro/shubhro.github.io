#### Abstract

We evaluate a large-scale randomized experiment promoting COVID-19 vaccination in 249 villages in Bihar, India. In the treatment villages, we established temporary village clinics or provided door-to-door administration of vaccines. We coupled our vaccination provision treatments by cross-randomizing financial incentives (about one day's wages) to recipients of the vaccines or health workers in the form of grocery vouchers or food packets. The results show the interventions increased self-reported vaccination rates by about 13 percentage points on average during the study period, representing 30\% of eligible individuals. Though some incentives went to inframarginal vaccine recipients, cost-benefit analysis accounting for mortality reductions indicates strong net benefits. Subgroup analysis found interventions slightly more impactful for women and adults below age 60. The findings demonstrate that combining sizable financial incentives with convenience through village clinics or household visits can substantially boost vaccine uptake. This approach appears highly cost-effective even in resource-constrained settings with limited health infrastructure.
